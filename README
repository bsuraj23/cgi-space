cgi-space is a python-cgi script that gives information about your server's disk status.
It doesn't require any configuration or skill to use. It's pretty straight forward and simple.

Put space.cgi and dstatus.py to your cgi directory.
Only linux systems supported, yet.
You can see a demo on http://t.bot.nu/cgi-space/space.cgi
